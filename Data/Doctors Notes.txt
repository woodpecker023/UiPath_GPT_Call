Goldy Mynard is experiencing frequent headaches, occurring 2-3 times a week, with no specific trigger identified yet. The following medications have been prescribed: Aspirin and Dihydroergotamine.
The patient's blood pressure is elevated. A blood pressure reading of 110/95 mmHg indicates stage 1 hypertension. Elevated blood pressure can be a cause for concern, especially when dealing with headaches. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential to prevent any potential complications.
The patient's weight is within normal limits, which is a positive sign. Maintaining a healthy weight (now it is 130 lbs) and a height of 5.9 ft is important to reduce the risk of complications associated with headaches, such as migraines.
The patient's blood oxygen levels of 93% are slightly below normal limits. This may indicate some form of respiratory distress, which could be contributing to the headaches. The patient may require further investigation to identify the underlying cause.
The patient's resting heart rate is within normal limits, which is a positive sign. However, changes in heart rate which is currently eighty two bpm can be a sign of potential complications such as cardiovascular problems, which may need to be investigated further.
In addition to medication, Dr. Amit Patel has advised the patient to take the prescribed medication when a headache occurs. It is important to follow the prescribed dosage and timing instructions to ensure the effectiveness of the medication.
Further, no specific trigger for the headaches has been identified yet. The patient may need to keep a headache diary to identify potential triggers, which can help in preventing headaches.
In conclusion, close monitoring of vital signs is essential for patients experiencing frequent headaches. Elevated blood pressure, slightly low blood oxygen levels, and the presence of headaches warrant further investigation to identify potential underlying causes. Following the prescribed medication regimen and keeping track of headache triggers can help in preventing headaches and facilitating a smooth recovery.

The patient's resting heart rate 70 bpm is within normal limits. This is an important sign to monitor during the recovery period, as changes in heart rate can indicate potential complications such as bleeding or cardiac issues.
In addition to the medication regimen, the patient has been advised to refrain from washing her face for the next 3 days, and to simply wipe it with a wet cloth. This is to prevent any irritation or damage to the surgical site and to allow it to heal properly.
